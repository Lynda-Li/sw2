# Setup
The document explains how to install Skywalking based on the kind of probes you are going to use.
If you don't understand, please read [Concepts and Designs](../concepts-and-designs/README.md) first.


**Important: Don't forget to configure the timezone on your UI, and you also need to be sure your OAP backend servers are also using the same timezone.**
